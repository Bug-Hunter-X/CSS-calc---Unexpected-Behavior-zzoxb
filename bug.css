The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can sometimes produce unexpected results when combined with other properties or units.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` within a nested element might not work as expected if the parent element doesn't have a defined width.  Another issue is that calculations involving percentages can be difficult to debug and might produce different results in different browsers due to rounding or order of operations differences.  Incorrect use of units can also lead to unexpected results, such as mixing pixels and ems without accounting for context.
